  - text: |-
      When comparing AWS, Azure, and GCP security features:

      1) Identity Management: All three offer robust IAM, with Azure AD having strong enterprise integration, AWS IAM providing fine-grained policies, and GCP's IAM integrating with Google Workspace.

      2) Network Security: AWS offers Security Groups and NACLs, Azure provides Network Security Groups, and GCP has VPC firewall rules and Cloud Armor.

      3) Data Protection: All offer encryption at rest and in transit, with key management services (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, Cloud KMS).

      4) Compliance: All maintain major certifications (ISO, SOC, PCI), but Azure often has an edge for government compliance.

      5) Security Services: AWS has GuardDuty and Security Hub, Azure has Security Center and Sentinel, and GCP has Security Command Center and Cloud Armor.

      The best choice depends on your specific needs and existing technology stack.
